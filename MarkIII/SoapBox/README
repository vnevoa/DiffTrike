This is the place for all the files that implement the SoapBox Mark III proof-of-concept controller, in its third incarnation platform. Everything here is copied into the on-board controller of the Trike. 
Currently the chosen Hardware for this controller is a Raspberry Pi board, type A (use /dev/i2c-0 instead of /dev/i2c-1 on type B) plus a pair of Devantech MD03 power controllers.

The GNU/Linux distribution used as a basis for this controller is the Debian based "Raspbian" because it is the one suggested by the RasPi community.
You can download the latest card-flashable images from http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads and flash them onto the SD-card by following these instructions: http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup

After flashing and booting it and running the built-in configuration wizard, just copy over the files to /home/pi/SoapBoxMkIII/, open up a console (local or SSH) and run the install script by doing "chmod +x /home/pi/SoapBoxMkIII/sbinstall.sh; sudo /home/pi/SoapBoxMkIII/sbinstall.sh".

Project files and their function:
- "sbinstall.sh": the installation script for this software package into a Raspbian distro.
- "interfaces" corresponds to the /etc/network/interfaces linux configuration file.
- "soapbox.sh" is a SysV init script that launches and kills the controller application once it is installed in /etc/init.d/ and links produced with "update-rc.d soapbox.sh defaults".
- "sb.py": the control application itself, to be placed in /home/pi/SoapBoxMkIII/.
- "sb_*.py": the custom modules necessary to the main application, also going into /home/pi/SoapBoxMkIII/.
