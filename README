The DiffTrike project attempts to develop the embedded controller
for a Differential Traction Hybrid Human-Electric Tricycle.

The project hosts two sets of files:
- one to execute in the Trike controller itself, called "SoapBox";
- one to optionally execute in a remote computer, called "RemoteMonitor".

The copyright licence of this Open Source project's files is the GNU GPL version 3.
Feel free to hack away, fork, or contribute. 
Just don't ask me for money for any reason whatsoever. :)
